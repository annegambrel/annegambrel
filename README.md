### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹:penguin:
I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Civis Analytics working on building models for voter turnout and demographics. 


Before that, I was a KICP Fellow at the University of Chicago where I worked on [building tools](https://github.com/SPIDER-CMB/xfaster) to [analyze large cosmological data sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01172).
