### Hi there! 👋 🐧
I'm a data scientist in progressive data. I previously worked at the DSCC during the 2024 election to help Democratic Senate campaigns target their outreach efficiently. Before that, I was at Civis Analytics building models and pipelines for political organizations, governments, and nonprofits to better reach donors and serve their constituents. 


In a previous life, I was a KICP Fellow at the University of Chicago where I worked on [building tools](https://github.com/SPIDER-CMB/xfaster) to [analyze large cosmological data sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01172).
